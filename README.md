# PSU\_lemipc\_2017

## Project
Epitech 2nd year project.

The goal of this project is to create a game where AI fight on a board in teams. There's only one binary and all players share the same map stored in memory (using concurrency).


## Prerequisites
There's no prerequisites to run the project.



## How to use it
To use this program, you first need to compile it using the makefile :

To compile the program :    

    make re && make clean


Then, just launch it :

    ./lemipc [path] [team number]

If you want more players on the map, just launch the program again in an other terminal, while the first one is still running.
